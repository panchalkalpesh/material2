`<md-expansion-panel>` provides an expandable details-summary view.

<!-- example(expansion-overview) -->

### Expansion-panel content

Each expansion-panel must include a header and may optionally include an action bar.

#### Header

The `<md-expansion-panel-header>` shows a summary of the panel content and acts
as the control for expanding and collapsing. This header may optionally contain an
`<md-panel-title>` and an `<md-panel-description>`, which format the content of the
header to align with Material Design specifications.

By default, the expansion-panel header includes a toggle icon at the end of the
header to indicate the expansion state. This icon can be hidden via the
`hideToggle` property.

```html
<md-expansion-panel>
  <md-expansion-panel-header>
    <md-panel-title>
      This is the expansion title
    </md-panel-title>
    <md-panel-description>
      This is a summary of the content
    </md-panel-description>
  </md-expansion-panel-header>

  <p>This is the primary content of the panel.</p>

</md-expansion-panel>
```

#### Action bar

Actions may optionally be included at the bottom of the panel, visible only when the expansion
is in its expanded state.

```html
<md-expansion-panel>
  <md-expansion-panel-header>
    This is the expansion title
  </md-expansion-panel-header>

  <p>This is the primary content of the panel.</p>

  <md-action-row>
    <button md-button>Click me</button>
  </md-action-row>
</md-expansion-panel>
```

#### Disabling a panel

Expansion panels can be disabled using the `disabled` attribute. A disabled expansion panel can't
be toggled by the user, but can still be manipulated using programmatically.

```html
<md-expansion-panel [disabled]="isDisabled">
  <md-expansion-panel-header>
    This is the expansion title
  </md-expansion-panel-header>
  <md-panel-description>
    This is a summary of the content
  </md-panel-description>
</md-expansion-panel>
```


### Accordion

Multiple expansion-panels can be combined into an accordion. The `multi="true"` input allows the
expansions state to be set independently of each other. When `multi="false"` (default) just one
panel can be expanded at a given time:

```html
<md-accordion>

  <md-expansion-panel>
    <md-expansion-panel-header>
      This is the expansion 1 title
    </md-expansion-panel-header>

    This the expansion 1 content

  </md-expansion-panel>

  <md-expansion-panel>
    <md-expansion-panel-header>
      This is the expansion 2 title
    </md-expansion-panel-header>

    This the expansion 2 content

  </md-expansion-panel>

</md-accordion>
```
